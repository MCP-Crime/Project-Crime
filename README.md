## Problem
Traveling to a large metropolitan area can be a fun experience, but if you are like me traveling to a new large area can also be a bit intimidating, will I get lost will I make a wrong turn and end up in a rough neighborhood.  Most people are oblivious to their surroundings when they travel.  The fact is that crime continues to rise and you need to be aware of your surroundings.  Taking Chicago as our problem there is plenty of information available on crimes and stats, however for a person traveling there is no easy way to select the location you be be going to and get an overview of the neighborhood and the type and amounts of crimes that have or have not occurred at that location. 

After documented all the possible solutions I have settled on one manageable option based off the constructive feedback received.

## Appetite
Overall break down can be achieved in two equal development cycles broken into 6 week in order to keep everything manageable.

## Solution
To solve this problem we will look to leveraging all the data available to us from the city of Chicago  Crime API and build a set of functionality that will allow the user to easily identify an area of the city and get an overview of the crimes that have occurred in and around that area, while also allowing the user to filter down into crimes that have happened over a certain time window.   As an exmaple current day, week or month.

Allow for street destination input and then display all crimes in that area in tabular view broken out by location address, type of crime and arrest we can also look at date and time of the crime.  Look to lean more on analysis for the user than graphical approaches.
